# liri-node-app

#An app for finding info on artists, songs, and movies. 
#Just Type one of the four options 
1. concert-this Metallica
2. movie-this Dunkirk
3. spotify-this-song All The Small Things
4. do-what-it-says 

You will recieve info on whatever artist, song, or movie you searched. Do-what-it-says will randomly generate a command and input search value. 
This app is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface built using Node-Spotify-API, Axios, Moment, DotEnv, and Inquirer NPMs. I am also using the Bands In Town and OMDB Apis.
Hope you enjoy!
